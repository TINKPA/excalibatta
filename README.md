# Excalibatta

![](./cover.png)

A small puzzle game built in Excalibur and React.  
This game is a Excalibur port of a React game called [Ciabattas Revenge](https://drewconley.itch.io/ciabattas-revenge)

The core game mechanic, concepts and assets are all based on the excellent tutorial series by Drew Conley.  
The tutorial series can be found here: https://courses.drewconley.dev/
